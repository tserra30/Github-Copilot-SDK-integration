### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning briefing with Copilot"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - service: conversation.process
        data:
          text: "Good morning! What should I know today?"
          agent_id: conversation.github_copilot
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [agents.md](agents.md)

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors**: Verify your API token is valid
- **Connection issues**: Check internet connectivity and GitHub API status
- **Slow responses**: Try reducing max_tokens or using a faster model
