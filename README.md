_Integration to bring GitHub Copilot AI capabilities to Home Assistant using the GitHub Copilot SDK._

**This integration provides a conversation agent powered by the GitHub Copilot SDK and Copilot CLI, enabling voice assistants and AI-powered tasks similar to OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini integrations.**

## Features

- 🤖 **Conversation Agent** - Use GitHub Copilot as an AI conversation agent
- 🎤 **Voice Assistant Support** - Works with Home Assistant's voice pipeline
- 🔧 **Configurable Models** - Support for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, o3-mini, o1, o1-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- 💬 **Context Preservation** - Maintains conversation history within sessions via the SDK
- ⚠️ **Copilot CLI Required** - The GitHub Copilot SDK uses the Copilot CLI for authentication and runtime

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the "+" button
4. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
5. Click "Install"
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/github_copilot` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Setup via UI

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **GitHub Copilot**
4. Enter your GitHub token for Copilot SDK authentication
5. Configure optional settings:
   - **Model**: Select from GPT-4o (default), GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, o3-mini, o1, o1-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Claude 3.7 Sonnet

### Getting a GitHub Token

To use this integration, you need a GitHub personal access token that can authenticate the Copilot SDK:
1. Ensure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription
2. Install the GitHub Copilot CLI and sign in, or provide a PAT token for the SDK.
3. Generate a PAT token from your GitHub developer settings.
4. Make sure to add the necessary permissions to the token. (e.g., Copilot requests)
5. Keep the token secure

## Usage

### As a Conversation Agent

Once configured, you can:

1. Select GitHub Copilot as a conversation agent in voice assistants
2. Use it in automations via the `conversation.process` service
3. Chat with it through the Home Assistant UI

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning briefing with Copilot"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - service: conversation.process
        data:
          text: "Good morning! What should I know today?"
          agent_id: conversation.github_copilot
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [agents.md](agents.md)

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors**: Verify your GitHub token is valid for the Copilot SDK
- **Connection issues**: Check internet connectivity and Copilot CLI status
- **Slow responses**: Try using a faster model or reducing concurrent requests
